## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. It's okay if features repeat on different apps
App 1: YouTube Music
- Sleep Timer: set timer for long music to stop -> prevent music playing whole night
- Recommendation: relevant genre of music will play next after current music
App 2: Discord
- Custom and dynamic effects on personal profile
- App icon color freely changed
App 3: App Store
- Suggestion sections on Today section expand and minimize smoothly
- Dynamic effects on suggestion sections
App 4: Messenger
- Post a note as a quick and small text popping up on person's icon in app
- Stories section for quick access without Facebook
App 5: Gmail
- Window for switching between accounts
- Change status between busy and active and so on

Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not committing to this idea, but it helps to start brainstorming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.
App: Enhanced Pomodoro App
Enhanced Pomodoro App contains the features of a standard pomodoro app including focus timer, break timer, long break timer, and setting to customize the time period and background and ringtone. I would like improve the app by adding features used to block entertainment and games app during focus timer. That will prevent accidental click on unwanted app and get distracted.
## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The challenges encounted are getting used to macOS including copying and moving files around, figuring out how to use Xcode in the first place, and its simulator.
